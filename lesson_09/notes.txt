
Linear Search (target 150, 8 searches)   worst case is n searches
[13, 45, 67, 89, 101, 120, 130, 150, 190, 300, 400]
 0   1   2    3   4    5    6    7   8     9    10

 BinarySearch (4 searches)  worst case is log2 n searches
 120 - 190 - 130 - 150

 Linear Search has efficiency of O(n)
 Binary Search has efficiency of O(log n)


O(3N^2 + 3N + 62) = O(N^2)
// discard the lower terms and take the highest term
